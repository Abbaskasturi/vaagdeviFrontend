Vaagdevi Exchange Platform
Welcome to the Vaagdevi Exchange Platform! This is a full-stack web application built from the ground up to create a peer-to-peer rental marketplace exclusively for college students.

Think of it like a community closet for our campus. Instead of buying a drafter for a single semester or a camera for a weekend trip, students can rent one from a fellow student. Itâ€™s all about making college life more affordable and sustainable by letting students earn money from their unused items and save money by renting what they need.

How It's Built: The User Journey
Let's walk through the main feature: renting a bike. This shows how the frontend and backend collaborate.

A student logs in. The React app sends the email and password to the /api/auth/login endpoint on the backend. The backend checks the database, and if the credentials are correct, it sends back a JWT, which the React app saves in the browser's cookies.

They browse the "Bikes" page. The React app navigates to the /bikes page. It then makes a GET request to the backend at /api/products/bikes. The backend queries the database for all bikes and sends back a list of bike data as JSON. The React app then uses this data to display all the available bikes in a clean, card-based layout.

The student decides to rent a bike. They click a "Rent" button on a specific bike. This triggers a POST request to the /api/rentals endpoint, sending along the bike's ID and the rental dates. Crucially, it also sends the user's JWT to prove who they are.

The bike's owner gets notified. The backend receives the rental request. It creates a new "pending" rental in the database and also creates a notification for the bike's owner.

The owner approves the request. The owner logs in and goes to their "My Listings" page, which fetches all their pending requests from /api/rentals/my-listings. They see the new request and click "Approve." This sends a PATCH request to /api/rentals/:id/status, telling the backend to change the rental's status to "active."

The renter is notified. The backend updates the rental status and creates a new notification for the original renter, letting them know their request was approved. The next time the renter visits their "My Rentals" page, they'll see the updated status.

This end-to-end flow is the core of the application and demonstrates how the frontend and backend work in tandem to create a complete and interactive experience.
